    * Addded support for the findnext action

07/21/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added better horizontal scrolling support. It isn't perfect because
      it's hard to know the true width of the line because parts of it
      can have bold text while other parts don't.

07/20/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added Japanese translation
    * Fixed syntax highlighting colors when you first load jsXe

06/23/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added back rudimentary key bindings using Swing Actions so they get
      dispached by Swing and are displayed in menus. But infrastructure is
      in place to allow jsXe to catch key bindings itself.

    * Fixed bug 1433905. I implemented end of line markers when I didn't need
      to. And I implemented them wrong, introducing this bug.

02/19/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed bug 1433918. The JEditTextArea now creates a new set of defaults
      for each instance of JEditTextArea. Each new text area was using the same
      InputHandler instance so the key bindings for each text area were being
      overridden.

02/11/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added end of line markers and and option to turn them on or off.
    * Added support for maintaining indent when adding new lines
    * Implemented maintaining indent when adding new lines and soft tabs
      by adding key bindings to the input handler rather than overriding
      processKeyEvent or whatever

      subsets.

      take you to the first/last non-whitespace characters.

02/02/2006  Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

      own localized messages.

    * Added the goToLine() method to SourceView to maintain the contract for
      DocumentView

05/18/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Enhanced the syntax highlighting to support highlighting namespace
      prefixes and markup.
    * The source view now highlights ]]> in text as invalid because it is.
    * Fixed bug that caused attribute values to be highlighted incorrectly if
      the attribute had different types of quotes in it. Like
      value="blah='test'"

05/10/2005  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed the soft tabs option, key mnemonics, and scrollbar after adding
      syntax highlighting support.
