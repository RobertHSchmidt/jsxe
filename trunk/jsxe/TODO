TODO:

-Fix the Options dialog to have a view specific part and a jsXe application specific part. This will allow users to set options for the view as well as options for the program itself.
-Create a history class for the DefaultView that keeps track of the current state of the view and can be used to restore it later.
-Change the DOMSerializer class to conform to the DOM3 standard DOMWriter class.
-allow for selecting multiple files when opening
-allow for opening files with wellformedness errors in source view. This way users can fix wellformedness errors in the editor.
-Add a context menu so you can add and delete nodes etc.
-fix updating of the tree when users are changing a text node.
-fix error handling so that errors are handled better when read errors occur etc.
