    * Want to allow GUI models to register change listeners with XMLDocuments
      and AdapterNodes. This will allow GUI models to be updated automatically
      when the DOM is changed. Also add property change listeners so that views
      can be updated when properties (options) change. Update the views to
      register listeners with the XMLDocuments and AdapterNodes so they update
      themselves when they change. How should I do this? How can I use the
      Document interface to register change listeners? Can I create my own
      implementation of the Document interface without having to write a
      DOMBuilder?

      etc.)
