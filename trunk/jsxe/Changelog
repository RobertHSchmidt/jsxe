10/30/2003  version 0.1.39  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for dirty files. When you make changes to a document
      it is marked dirty and has an '*' in the tab name. jsXe also asks you
      if you want to save if you have dirty documents open.
    * Fixed many miscellaneous bugs.
    * AdapterNodes notify the XMLDocument parent when changes are made to the
      DOM.

10/23/2003  version 0.1.38  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that caused an error message and undesired behavior when
      removing nodes.

10/23/2003  version 0.1.37  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed the problem where the parser couldn't resolve the location
      of an external entity. Made it so that the parser searched for
      the entity relative to the document's path and not the path
      where you started jsXe.
    * Changed to new versioning system so that build versions and
      major and minor version builds update jsXe's version automatically in
      the build.properties.
    * Changed SourceViewDocument to not update the XMLDocument's model each
      time you insert text but set the text only after all editing is complete.
      This improves performance but does not update the encoding when you change
      it in the properties. Since I am going to change it so that you can't edit
      the header in source view anyway, this isn't as much of an issue.

10/20/2003  version 0.1.17  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added the ability to register listeners with the AdapterNode and
      XMLDocument interfaces.
    * Updated GUI classes to register listeners with the XMLDocuments and
      update themselves when properties change.

10/08/2003  version 0.1.16  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made AdapterNodes persistent. Now the JTree functions like it
      should when updateUI is called on it.

09/07/2003  version 0.1.15  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added functionality to the XMLDocument interface for adding listeners
      so objects can be notified when the XML document changes.
      Added an interface XMLDocumentListener. Documented it with javadoc.
    * Fixed a bug that caused problems when saving as a file that was already
      open. This was fixed earlier but the bug was reintroduced somewhere.

9/01/2003   version 0.1.14  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed the XMLDocument validate() method to be checkWellFormedness().
      Changed the implementation of isValidated() to be named isWellFormed() and
      isWellFormed() now calls checkWellFormedNess to find out out whether it is
      well-formed or not.

8/31/2003   version 0.1.13  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed bug with createElement() creating elements with a null local name
      when element nodes are renamed. Used createElementNS() instead.
    * Fixed performance issues with opening files (that weren't even that
      large.)

8/30/2003   version 0.1.12  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a very bad bug where jsXe was not writing anything to files when
      saving because the OutputStreamWriter was not flushed.

8/30/2003   version 0.1.11  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added an indent width option to the options dialog. Currently only used
      when formatting a document while serializing and as the tab width in the
      source view.

8/29/2003   version 0.1.10  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed indentation when serializing a document.
    * Changed the layout of the options dialog. It looks a little better now.

8/28/2003   version 0.1.9  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed the DOMSerializer class to conform to the DOM3 standard
      DOMWriter (old) interface. Used the java.io.OutputStreamWriter class for
      encoding. Added an encoding option to the option dialog.
    * Fixed bug in DefaultXMLDocument that messed up which model the object was
      using.
    * Fixed bug with createElement() creating elements with a null local name.
      Used createElementNS() instead.

8/24/2003   version 0.1.7   Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated Serialization and options dialog.

8/24/2003   version 0.1.6   Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Implemented more features for DOMSerializer.
    * Updated the Options Dialog to have serialization options.

8/18/2003   version 0.1.5   Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated DOMSerializer to work with basic features and formatting.

7/31/2003   version 0.1.4   Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Moved the DOMSerializer towards dom3 complience.

7/21/2003   version 0.1.3   Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added javadoc to CustomFileFilter.java
    * Updated the headers of all the files.
    * Changed how jsXe saves files so that the XMLDocument class is independent
      of gui implementation.
    * Fixed a bug where jsXe didn't update the XMLDocument name in the
      TabbedView.
    * Fixed a bug that caused problems when saving as a file that was already
      open.

7/16/2003   version 0.1.2   Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added javadoc to jsXe.java and TabbedView.java. Added a context menu to
      the attributes table so that attributes can be removed.

07/09/2003  version 0.1.1   Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Initial Release. Simple functions are implemented for tree view, add
      element and text nodes, remove nodes etc. Source view is a normal text
      area with which you can edit the source of the XML document.
