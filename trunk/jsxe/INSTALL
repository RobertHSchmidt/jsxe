BUILDING jsXe FROM SOURCE

This is pretty simple. You will need jakarta ANT and a Sun's javac compiler.
Also, in order for jsXe to compile properly you will need Apache Xerces
installed. You should probobly have 1.3.1 or better of java and you will need
2.6.0 of Xerces. To build the distribution you will need to run the 'dist'
target in the build.xml file. I to this by simply typing 'ant dist' or just
'ant'. 'dist' should be the default target. A Xerces 2.6.0 binary distribution
is included in this source tree. You can aquire the source at
http://xml.apache.org/

RUNNING jsXe
