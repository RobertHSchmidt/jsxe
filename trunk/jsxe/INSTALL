BUILDING jsXe FROM SOURCE

This is pretty simple. You will need jakarta ANT and a Sun's javac compiler
(others might work, I just haven't tested them). Also, in order for jsXe to
compile properly you will need Apache Xerces installed.

You should probobly have 1.3.1 or better of java and you will need 2.6.0 of
Xerces. The jar files xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar from the 2.6.0
distribution are required. These should be placed in a directory called lib in
jsXe's root folder (where you installed jsXe) or in the jre/lib/ext or lib/ext
in your JVM. These jar files will be included with jsXe distributions for
convenience.

Simply typing 'ant' in jsXe's root directory will give you the available targets
to use with ant. To just simply compile jsXe to a jar file you can type 'ant
compile'. To build a binary distribution you will need to run the 'dist' target
in the build.xml file. I to this by simply typing 'ant dist'. Source
distributions can be built using the 'src' target by typing 'ant src'.

A Xerces 2.6.0 binary distribution is not included in the CVS source tree. You
can aquire the source at http://xml.apache.org/

RUNNING jsXe

You should probably have 1.3.1 or better of java and you need 2.6.0 of Xerces.
To run jsXe you should just run the java interpreter on the jsXe.jar file. There
is a shell script or batch file included in the source tree for this purpose.

    ./bin/jsXe.sh

or

    ./bin/jsXe.bat

The batch program should be run in with the jsXe root directory of as the
working directory. So you can create a shortcut to run jsXe by specifying the
batch file as the program to run and jsXe's root directory as the working
directory.

Ex.
Target:   "C:\Program Files\jsXe\bin\jsXe.bat"
Start in: "C:\Program Files\jsXe\"
