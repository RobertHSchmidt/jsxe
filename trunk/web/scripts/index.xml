    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      jsXe is the Java Simple XML Editor. Although you may pronounce it any way you
      wish i encourage you to pronounce it "jay sexy". It is written in java using the
      Swing toolkit, JAXP, and DOM and is released under the terms of the
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
      It aims to provide end users and developers with an intuitive way of creating XML
      documents. It is geared towards simpler XML documents but will (eventually) be
      able to handle any XML document.

    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      jsXe is currently in a planning and pre-alpha stage. It is not ready for
      extensive use and is considered a work in progress. If you require a free XML
      editor and jsXe does not currently serve your needs, i recommend that you try
      <a href="http://pollo.sourceforge.net">Pollo</a> or
      <a href="http://jaxe.sourceforge.net">Jaxe</a> (i didn't steal the name, i promise).
