<p>jsXe needs developers to implement new features and fix bugs,
   testers for testing jsXe, translators for translating messages and the
   website, and web designers who are interested in updating the project's
   website.</p>

<p>Getting involved is fairly easy. There are a multitude of ways that
   you can become involved in the project. The easiest is probably by
   subscribing to the mailing lists, however there are many methods at
   your disposal.</p>
 
<p>Note: Contributers will be expected to give their real names.</p>
