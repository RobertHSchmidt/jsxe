      <h2>Getting Involved</h2>
      
      <p>jsXe needs developers to implement new features and fix bugs,
         translators for translating messages and the website, and 
         web designers who are interested in updating the project's
         website.</p>
      
      <p>Getting involved is fairly easy. There are a multitude of ways that
         you can become involved in the project. The easiest is probably by
         subscribing to the mailing lists, however there are many methods at
         your disposal.</p>
