This module contains a number of test scripts for jsXe. These test scripts are
meant to be run using Marathon (http://marathonman.sourceforge.net). There are a
number of things you'll have to do to get started with testing.

* Export the 'jsxe', 'treeview', 'sourceview', and 'test' modules from CVS.
* Compile jsXe (you'll need to read the instructions in the jsXe module).
* Install Marathon
* Set up the Marathon project.

* Setting up the Marathon Project

Currently because Marathon saves the project file with absolute pathnames you
will have to create a project file for yourself manually.

When you start Marathon click New...

On the Project Tab:
Name the project anything you want but set the directory to the directory
where you exported the 'test' module from CVS.

On the Main Tab:
set the main class to 'net.sourceforge.jsxe.jsXe'
set the working directory to where you exported the 'jsxe' module from CVS

On the Classpath Tab:
Click add archives and add all jars from the jsxe/lib directory from the CVS
module. Also add the jsXe.jar file from the jsxe module.

On the Python Path Tab:
(you shouldn't have to do this one but I did for some reason)
Add the CaptureScripts directory from where you exported the 'test' module from
CVS.

Click Test and see if jsXe comes up properly.
Save the project and hit Ok.
