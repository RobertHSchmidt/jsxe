07/23/2004  version 0.2 pre11   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for a recent files list that can allow users to open
      files they have recently used.
    * Added an option to allow the user to specify the number of recent files
      that jsXe remembers
    * When jsXe opens a file now it checks if it's in the recent files list
      and opens it with the remembered properties automatically

06/23/2004  version 0.2 pre10   Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed problem where the node did not appear to be selected after drag and
      drop but was. Needed to add the node to the selection model.
    * Removed references to the TabbedView from the DocumentViewFactory

06/22/2004  version 0.2 pre9    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that caused the right hand text pane to clear when trying to
      edit using it. When dragging and dropping a node the node stays selected
      but is not highlighted however. This may be confusing to users.

06/18/2004  version 0.2 pre8    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made some changes to make the DefaultView less dependent on jsXe classes

06/12/2004  version 0.2 pre7    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Removed references to the TabbedView and most jsXe application references.
    * Fixed a bug that causing jsXe to not update the title properly when a
      document was closed.

06/08/2004  version 0.2 pre6    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that caused a null pointer exception when reloading an
      untitled document.
    * Changed the DocumentView interface to return a Component via a
      method call instead of having it extend JPanel
    * Fixed a bug that caused ArrayOutOfBounds exceptions to be thrown
      sometimes when adding nodes via the JTree in DefaultView

05/30/2004  version 0.2 pre5    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Removed references to the DocumentBuffer class in the DocumentView 
      classes.

05/26/2004  version 0.2 pre4    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Removed redundant call to fireNameChanged() in DocumentBuffer
    * Moved code for setting the divider location of the split panes to an
      overridden version of setVisible(). This allows the DefaultView to set
      the divider locations after the parent container is made visible.

05/23/2004  version 0.2 pre4    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Allowed users to add a comment node to the document root.
    * fixed a bug that caused a processing instruction to not be printed on a
      new line when serialized.

05/23/2004  version 0.2 pre3    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added a new Reload action to the file menu so that users can reload the
      current document from disk

05/22/2004  version 0.2 pre2    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that caused non-dirty, non-untitled document to save when
      they were closed.
    * Added code for autoscrolling when doing drag and drop using the Autoscroll
      interface and fuctionality.
    * Added logic to expand tree nodes when you hover over them for a period of
      time.
    * Tooltip for processing instructions is now correct.
    * Changed the text for some nodes in the tree.
    * Changed versioning yet again so that we go 0.1.xx for build versions to
      0.1 beta since 1 should be the first minor version we have a beta for.
      Now 0.2 pre1 is the first development version preceding 0.2 beta, or
      second minor release.

05/18/2004  version 0.2 pre1    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Moved logic for the file chooser dialogs to a new jsxeFileDialog class

05/17/2004  version 0.1 beta    Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Code fixed for version 0.1 beta
    * changed version naming scheme. Development versions are now the next
      major.minor version with a preXX at the end (eg. 0.2 pre75). Mostly done
      so it's easier to put the version in the build file and have it make
      sense for beta/stable releases.

05/16/2004  version 0.1.75  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed many bugs in the DefaultViewTreeModel, DefaultViewTree,
      DefaultViewTreeNode, and AdapterNode
    * Added code to remember the expanded states of nodes after they are
      dragged and dropped into other nodes

05/15/2004  version 0.1.74  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added xsd files to the file filters when opening a document.

05/14/2004  version 0.1.73  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated the DOMSerializer to implement the newest version
      of the LSSerializer interface. jsXe requires Xerces 2.6.2.
    * Updated how the splitpane locations are set up. The look better now and
      and set themselves to a percentage of the window size as a starting
      value.

05/13/2004  version 0.1.72  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug in the displaying of nodes in the tree. The algorithm
      That desides if a node is to be displayed caused null pointer exceptions
      to be thrown.
    * Fixed various bugs. Moved logic for opening save dialogs to the
      DocumentBuffer class.
    * Fixed a bug in the inserting of nodes in the DefaultViewTreeNode class
      The setParent method wasn't setting the correct parent.

05/07/2004  version 0.1.71  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added a layer between the AdapterNode and the GUI. The DefaultViewTreeNode
      class contains properties for use with the GUI. AdapterNode now doesn't
      any GUI specific code in it.

04/23/2004  version 0.1.70  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed some syncing problems with the XMLDocument and client classes
      when the serialization process changes the structure of the document
      by splitting cdata-section nodes.
    * Fixed a bug that caused IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions to be thrown when
      writing a document over 5120 bytes.
    * Fixed a bug in the serializer that caused the root element opening tag
      to be placed directly after a document type definition.
    * updated how the DOMSerializer uses Writers. It uses them in a better way
      now.

04/23/2004  version 0.1.69  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that was causing comment nodes to indented too far
      when formatting the document during serialization.
    * Reworked the updatedMenuBar() method in the TabbedView so that
      it doesn't create the whole menubar from scratch each time it's
      updated.
    * Fixed a bug in serialization that caused only the public id and not
      the system id to be seraliazed if both existed in a doctype node.

04/22/2004  version 0.1.68  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a build problem that was introduced into cvs.
    * Fixed bug where jsxe generated NumberFormatExceptions if user defined
      saved properties were incorrectly formatted.
    * When a document is opened the document root element is now expanded
      by default.
    * When dragging and dropping and/or adding nodes the nodes that whose
      locations have changed are always visible after the change.
    * Added a Close All action to the file menu so that users can close all of
      the open xml documents at once.
    * Made it so that external dtds are not loaded since jsXe can't do anything
      with them anyway.
    * Implemented support for split-cdata-sections in the DOMSerializer

04/21/2004  version 0.1.67  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made it so that element nodes can't be edited in the JTree unless
      you select 'Rename Node' from the context menu. This is done because of
      some problems with compatiblity between the editing and drag and drop.
    * The DefaultView now uses the default options set in the
      documentview.default.props file. Any properties used by this class should
      have default values set in this properties file.

04/20/2004  version 0.1.66  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made split panes in the default tree view one touch expandable.
    * Made it so if opening a file and the only document open is untitled
      and clean then jsXe closes it.

04/18/2004  version 0.1.65  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Cleaned up some code in the TabbedView class. Removed the public update()
      method.
    * Changed some actions in the DefaultViewTree extend AbstractAction since
      they will probobly have key mnemonics in the future.
    * Added key mnemonics to the menu bar items so that you can navigate them
      easier using the keyboard.

04/17/2004  version 0.1.64  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added logic to the tree in the Default view so that dragged and dropped
      nodes are always visible after a drop. New nodes that are added
      through the context menu are also visible after they are added.
    * Fixed support for cdata-sections in the DOMSerializer

04/16/2004  version 0.1.63  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added logic to highlight a node when the user is going to drop onto a
      particular node.

04/04/2004  version 0.1.62  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed the problem where dragging an element node that was already
      selected initiated editing for that node. That was kind of silly so
      it doesn't do it any more.
    * Fixed a problem in the serialization where characters weren't resolved
      to entities in attributes

04/03/2004  version 0.1.61  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a couple bugs that caused null pointer exceptions when inserting
      around the document root.
    * Fixed it so that when you drag off the tree the cue line is erased.

04/02/2004  version 0.1.60  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added much better drag and drop support. You can now rearrange nodes
      with ease. The relative location of the drop is used to determine
      where to put the dragged node. Draws a line in between nodes in the
      JTree when nodes will be inserted before or after a node.

04/01/2004  version 0.1.59  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added an addAdaterNodeAt() method to the AdapterNode class so that
      it would be possible to add better drag and drop functionality, Notably
      being able to rearrange nodes within an element.
    * Added some more fold marks and javadoc to several classes.
    * Added the ability to rearrange text nodes and other nodes that aren't
      elements around within an element.
    * Added support for checking the version and getting command-line help
      for jsXe via command-line options
    * Fixed a bug that didn't allow users to open a document if the DTD couldn't
      be found. Still won't think it's well formed though.

03/31/2004  version 0.1.58  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * When you save out of the options panel after you changed options that
      change the XML document itself the open document is marked as dirty.
    * Fixed a bug where the source was not being changed when the encoding
      was changed because the XMLDocument object thought that the source
      was synced with the DOM.

03/18/2004  version 0.1.57  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added check so that dragging and dropping a node on it's parent doesn't
      do anything and the buffer is not marked dirty (since nothing really
      changed).

02/29/2004  version 0.1.56  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added preliminary drag n drop support for the tree in the default view.
      You can now drag nodes from one parent to another in the tree view. You
      can also drag a node to any thing that accepts text from a drag n drop
      operation.

02/27/2004  version 0.1.55  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Refactored the tree in the DefaultView to it's own class.
    * Added in some preliminary drag n drop stuff. Commented out
      so it will compile

02/21/2004  version 0.1.54  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * DOCTYPE nodes are no longer visible in the tree. Some other method for
      editing doc types will have to be added to jsXe later.

02/16/2004  version 0.1.53  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug introduced in 0.1.51 that caused formatting not to work in
      the source view and when saving.

02/08/2004  version 0.1.52  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for writing the internal part of a DOCTYPE to the XML
      document.

02/07/2004  version 0.1.51  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Cleaned up the DOMSerializer and DOMSerializerConfiguration classes
    * Added a flag to the DefaultXMLDocument class to tell if the DOM is synced
      with the text content in parsed mode. Now it won't sync and thus serialize
      the DOM to the content every time text is requested.

01/23/2004  version 0.1.50  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for soft tabs in the DOMSerializer
    * Fixed a bug with how AdapterNode keeps references to it's children.
    * Added support for discarding default attributes in the DOMSerializer.

12/21/2003  version 0.1.49  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed the icon that is rendered for a tree node when editing. Got some
      weird behaviour out of the JTree when using the previous CellRenderer. I
      created a new one that simply renders Element node icons since they are
      the only editable nodes in the JTree.
    * Updated the DOMSerializerConfiguration class to support all the DOM3 LS
      parameters (even if the DOMSerializer itself doesn't yet).

12/20/2003  version 0.1.48  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Merged some of Bilel's changes to AdapterNode making it better able to
      handle more XML node types.
    * Nodes in the default view tree are now rendered as different icons for
      different node types. (Note: used icons from XML plugin for jEdit)

12/19/2003  version 0.1.47  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a minor bug in the logic to update tab titles.
    * jsXe now asks you if you really want to overwrite existing files on disk.

12/18/2003  version 0.1.46  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed tabs to use icons instead of appending a '*' to the tab name to
      indicate a file is dirty.
    * Added javadoc to the AdapterNode class.
    * Changed the security mode for the getNode() and setParentNode() methods
      in AdapterNode from protected to default. All other classes should use
      the public interface.

12/16/2003  version 0.1.45  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug in the attributes table where it wasn't updated properly.
      It now updates properly and sorts based on the order in which they will
      be serialized (alphabetical).
    * Updated many of the interfaces to make them more OO like. Before,
      DefaultView and TabbedView could be created but would have wierd default
      values and relied on the user to initialize them with a document. Now an
      initial document is required to construct them. This should be better for
      reuse.
    * Added a "Rename Node" action to the default view tree's context menu. You
      can still rename it by clicking twice (not double clicking) on the element
      node.

12/14/2003  version 0.1.44  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated the DOMSerializer and related classes to be compliant with the
      latest version of the DOM3. So now jsXe requires Xerces 2.6.0.
    * Fixed a bug where the html pane was editable after opening a new document
      though no node was selected.

11/19/2003  version 0.1.43  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug in the CustomFileFilter class that caused it to go into
      an infinite loop with files with no extension.
    * When opening an XML document jsXe now cycles through installed views
      until it finds one that will open a document. This allows opening
      documents that are not well formed in the source view.
    * Added support for opening multiple files at a time. Fixed a few bugs
      in that process.
    * Fixed an EntityResolver bug that was introduced with the DocumentBuffer
      class.

11/15/2003  version 0.1.42  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed the XMLDocument and DefaultXMLDocument classes to handle insertion
      and removal of raw text.
    * DefaultXMLDocument now stores text in a ContextManager object much like
      the way jEdit stores text. This should be more efficient and more scalable
      to large files than storing the raw text in String object.
    * Created a DocumentBuffer class to handle editor/application specific
      things like the underlying file on disk, the name of the buffer, whether
      it's dirty or not etc...
    * Documents can now be serialized/written to disk even if they are not
      well-formed (However, they still can't be opened).

11/11/2003  version 0.1.41  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed problem where the tree in the default view allowed you to select
      multiple nodes and cause undesired operation.

11/10/2003  version 0.1.40  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed bug where the * dirty file indicator was going away when switching
      views.
    * Fixed a bug where a document was marked dirty when switching views.

10/30/2003  version 0.1.39  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added support for dirty files. When you make changes to a document
      it is marked dirty and has an '*' in the tab name. jsXe also asks you
      if you want to save if you have dirty documents open.
    * Fixed many miscellaneous bugs.
    * AdapterNodes notify the XMLDocument parent when changes are made to the
      DOM.

10/23/2003  version 0.1.38  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a bug that caused an error message and undesired behavior when
      removing nodes.

10/23/2003  version 0.1.37  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed the problem where the parser couldn't resolve the location
      of an external entity. Made it so that the parser searched for
      the entity relative to the document's path and not the path
      where you started jsXe.
    * Changed to new versioning system so that build versions and
      major and minor version builds update jsXe's version automatically in
      the build.properties.
    * Changed SourceViewDocument to not update the XMLDocument's model each
      time you insert text but set the text only after all editing is complete.
      This improves performance but does not update the encoding when you change
      it in the properties. Since I am going to change it so that you can't edit
      the header in source view anyway, this isn't as much of an issue.

10/20/2003  version 0.1.17  Ian Lewis <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added the ability to register listeners with the AdapterNode and
      XMLDocument interfaces.
    * Updated GUI classes to register listeners with the XMLDocuments and
      update themselves when properties change.

10/08/2003  version 0.1.16  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Made AdapterNodes persistent. Now the JTree functions like it
      should when updateUI is called on it.

09/07/2003  version 0.1.15  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added functionality to the XMLDocument interface for adding listeners
      so objects can be notified when the XML document changes.
      Added an interface XMLDocumentListener. Documented it with javadoc.
    * Fixed a bug that caused problems when saving as a file that was already
      open. This was fixed earlier but the bug was reintroduced somewhere.

9/01/2003   version 0.1.14  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed the XMLDocument validate() method to be checkWellFormedness().
      Changed the implementation of isValidated() to be named isWellFormed() and
      isWellFormed() now calls checkWellFormedNess to find out out whether it is
      well-formed or not.

8/31/2003   version 0.1.13  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed bug with createElement() creating elements with a null local name
      when element nodes are renamed. Used createElementNS() instead.
    * Fixed performance issues with opening files (that weren't even that
      large.)

8/30/2003   version 0.1.12  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed a very bad bug where jsXe was not writing anything to files when
      saving because the OutputStreamWriter was not flushed.

8/30/2003   version 0.1.11  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added an indent width option to the options dialog. Currently only used
      when formatting a document while serializing and as the tab width in the
      source view.

8/29/2003   version 0.1.10  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Fixed indentation when serializing a document.
    * Changed the layout of the options dialog. It looks a little better now.

8/28/2003   version 0.1.9  Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Changed the DOMSerializer class to conform to the DOM3 standard
      DOMWriter (old) interface. Used the java.io.OutputStreamWriter class for
      encoding. Added an encoding option to the option dialog.
    * Fixed bug in DefaultXMLDocument that messed up which model the object was
      using.
    * Fixed bug with createElement() creating elements with a null local name.
      Used createElementNS() instead.

8/24/2003   version 0.1.7   Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated Serialization and options dialog.

8/24/2003   version 0.1.6   Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Implemented more features for DOMSerializer.
    * Updated the Options Dialog to have serialization options.

8/18/2003   version 0.1.5   Ian Lewis  <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Updated DOMSerializer to work with basic features and formatting.

7/31/2003   version 0.1.4   Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Moved the DOMSerializer towards dom3 complience.

7/21/2003   version 0.1.3   Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added javadoc to CustomFileFilter.java
    * Updated the headers of all the files.
    * Changed how jsXe saves files so that the XMLDocument class is independent
      of gui implementation.
    * Fixed a bug where jsXe didn't update the XMLDocument name in the
      TabbedView.
    * Fixed a bug that caused problems when saving as a file that was already
      open.

7/16/2003   version 0.1.2   Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Added javadoc to jsXe.java and TabbedView.java. Added a context menu to
      the attributes table so that attributes can be removed.

07/09/2003  version 0.1.1   Ian Lewis   <IanLewis@member.fsf.org>

    * Initial Release. Simple functions are implemented for tree view, add
      element and text nodes, remove nodes etc. Source view is a normal text
      area with which you can edit the source of the XML document.
