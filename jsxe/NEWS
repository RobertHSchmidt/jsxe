11/23/2003  version 0.1.43

    * jsXe can now open more than one file at a time.
    * jsXe can now open and save files that are not well-formed.
    * Fixed bug where jsXe would only open the first file given several files
      on the command line.
    * Fixed bug where the * dirty file indicator was going away when switching
      views.
    * Fixed a bug where a document was marked dirty when switching views.
    * Fixed problem where the tree in the default view allowed you to select
      multiple nodes and cause undesired operation.

10/30/2003  version 0.1.39

    * Added support for dirty files. When you make changes to a document
      it is marked dirty and has an '*' in the tab name. jsXe also asks you
      if you want to save if you have dirty documents open.
    * Fixed a bug that caused an error message and undesired behavior when
      removing nodes.
    * Fixed many miscellaneous bugs.

10/23/2003  version 0.1.37

    * Fixed the problem with jsXe not finding DTD documents and other external
      entities.
    * jsXe now updates the interface more after you change a document's options.
    * Fixed the problem with the tree view collapsing after adding new nodes
      or changing some nodes.
    * Fixed a bug that caused problems when saving as a file that was already
      open. This was fixed earlier but the bug was reintroduced somewhere.
    * Changed to a new version system where the build version is updated
      automatically. This means the build version will get higher faster.
    * Fixed some other bugs.

08/31/2003  version 0.1.13

    * Fixed another nasty bug with createElement() creating elements with a
      null local name when element nodes are renamed. Used createElementNS()
      instead.
    * Fixed performance issues with opening files (that weren't even that
      large.)

08/30/2003  version 0.1.12

    * Fixed a very nasty bug that caused jsXe to save blank files.

08/30/2003  version 0.1.11
    
    * jsXe has some more options. The options are specific to each open XML
      Document. These include the an encoding drop down box and the ability to
      format XML output.

    * Several enhancements have been made to serialization of XML documents.
      This allows for better looking and more flexable saved documents and
      source.

    * Fixed a bug that caused uncaught exceptions when saving a file as an
      already open file.

    * Fixed a bug when writing files that causes characters like < > ' to not
      be written properly.

07/09/2003  version 0.1.1

    * Initial Release. Simple functions are implemented for tree view, add
      element and text nodes, remove nodes etc. Source view is a normal text
      area with which you can edit the source of the XML document.
