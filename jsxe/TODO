TODO:

    * Document methods with javadoc.
    
    * Change the DOMSerializer class to conform to the DOM3 standard DOMWriter
      interface. For encoding use the java.io.OutputStreamWriter class. Add an
      encoding option to the option dialog.
    
    * Research the EntityResolver class and see if it can be used to resolve
      DTD files.
    
    * Build an adapter for DocumentBuilder so that it implements the DOM3
      standard DOMBuilder interface?
    
    * Use the Nodefilter interface with the DefaultView to determine which types
      of nodes to show.
    
    * Add funtionality for dirty files.
    
    * Allow for selecting multiple files when opening.
    
    * Fix the options dialog and make it look better. Maybe split into two
      dialogs, global options and view/document specific?
    
    * Allow for opening files with wellformedness errors in source view. This
      way users can fix wellformedness errors in the editor.
    
    * Currently AdapterNodes only wrap the Node interface and create new
      instances of itself when queried. Have AdapterNode implement the Node
      interface. This will allow the TreeModel to have a static model i.e. The
      instances of AdapterNode won't change everytime the TreeModel is queried
      by the JTree. e.g. Currently when I create a TreePath and call updateUI
      the TreePath is no longer valid because it contains objects no longer in
      the TreeModel. So when updating the UI I can't tell which Nodes were
      previously visable.
    
    * Make sure jsXe can deal with all types of XML nodes.
    
    * Change icons in tree in DocumentView to be different for different types
      of XML nodes.
    
    * Release a new version with the new features.
    
    * Allow GUI models to register change listeners with XMLDocuments and
      AdapterNodes. This will allow GUI models to be updated automatically when
      the DOM is changed.
    
    * Create a way for actions to be created dynamically and then registered
      with jsXe. Much the same way that jEdit does.
    
    * Create a toolbar that is customizable much the same way jEdit's is.
    
    * Create an interface for the main view in jsXe where the TabbedView
      implements it. Other views can then be created to allow a more
      customizable look.
    
    * Implement undo for the DefaultView and SourceView.
    
    * Implement syntax highlighting for the SourceView.
    
    * Add drag & drop functionality to the default view.
    
    * Create a history class for the DefaultView that keeps track of the current
      state of the view and can be used to restore it later.
    
    * Fix updating of the tree when users are changing a text node.
    
    * Implement plugin support with BeanShell. Make DocumentViews into plugins
      that are loaded at runtime. DefaultView and SourceView will be distributed
      with jsXe as the default views.
    
    * Add a way for jsXe to try to open a document in any of the installed views
      before it shows errors saying it cannot open the document. i.e. If a
      document is not validated try to open it in the requested view and if that
      fails then open it in one of the remaining installed views until it works
      or you run out of views.
    
    * Create an install program for jsXe.
    
    * Create a view that uses the view from pollo and implements the
      DocumentView interface.
    
    * Implement the xsl transformation feature.
    
    * Implement validation against DTDs and different forms of Schema.
    
    * Create a help system for jsXe.
