BUILDING jsXe FROM SOURCE

This is pretty simple. You will need jakarta ANT and a Sun's javac compiler.
Also, in order for jsXe to compile properly you will need Apache Xerces
installed. You should probobly have 1.3.1 or better of java and 2.3.0 or better
of Xerces. To build the distribution you will need to run the 'dist' target in
the build.xml file. I to this by simply typing 'ant dist' or just 'ant'. 'dist'
should be the default target.

RUNNING jsXe

You should proboblyhave 1.3.1 or better of java and 2.3.0 or better of Xerces.
To run jsXe you should just run the java interpreter on the jsXe.jar file. I
would do this by typing,

    java -jar jsXe.jar

If org.xml.sax and org.w3c.dom are not included with your java version you must
make sure that xerces is in your classpath. Like,

    java -cp xml-apis.jar;xercesImpl.jar -jar jsXe.jar
