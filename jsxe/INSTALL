REQUIREMENTS

Java 1.4.2
Xerces 2.8.0
launch4j (for building the installer from source)

GETTING jsXe

You can download jsXe's releases from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsxe
This will give you the source for jsXe and it's default plugins.

If you want to build from CVS you will need to check out the default plugins as
well as jsXe core. These are located in the modules 'treeview' and 'sourceview'.
Once you have the source trees for both of these you should put them in a
directory called 'jars' in your jsXe root folder. Once they are in that folder,
the ant targets (compile, bin, src, etc.) will recognise those plugins and build
them if necessary. So something like this should do it:

cvs checkout jsxe
cd jsxe
mkdir jars
cd jars
cvs checkout treeview
cvs checkout sourceview

BUILDING jsXe FROM SOURCE

** Requirements **

This is pretty simple. You will need jakarta ANT and a Sun's javac compiler
(others might work, I just haven't tested them). You will need the optional
ant tasks installed as well. On some Linux distributions this may be a separate
package. Also, in order for jsXe to compile properly you will need Apache 
Xerces installed.

You will need version 1.4.2 or better of java and you will need version 2.8.0 of
Xerces (A Xerces 2.8.0 binary distribution is not included in the CVS source
tree. You can aquire it at at http://xml.apache.org/) The jar files
xercesImpl.jar, xml-apis.jar, and resolver.jar from the 2.8.0 distribution are
required. These should be placed in a directory called lib in jsXe's root folder
(where you installed jsXe's source) or in the jre/lib/ext or lib/ext in your
JVM. These jar files will be included with jsXe distributions for convenience.

In order to build jsXe's installer or a windows distribution of jsXe you will
need to install launch4j (http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/). You can install it
in the buildlib directory or change the launch4j.dir property in the build.xml
file.

** Building **

Simply typing 'ant -p' in jsXe's root directory will give you the
available targets to use with ant. To just simply compile jsXe and the default
views to a jar file you can type 'ant compile'. To build a binary distribution
you will need to run the 'bin' target in the build.xml file. I do this by simply
typing 'ant bin'. Source distributions can be built using the 'src' target by
typing 'ant src'.

You can build jsXe's installer by running 'ant build-installer' which will
build jsXe's installer. The installer will be packaged in a jar file to be run
by java.

You can build a windows distribution of jsXe by running the 'ant win'. This will
compile jsXe's installer and wrap it in an exe wrapper. The wrapper will search
for the appropriate java runtime with which to run jsXe.

INSTALLING jsXe

Unpack the distribution file wherever you like. Normally you would install it
in  C:\Program Files\  or  /usr/local/share/  or something like that.

RUNNING jsXe

You should have 1.4.2 or better of java and you need 2.8.0 of Xerces.

*Windows*

Just run jsXe using the jsXe.exe in the install directory. The exe will
detect your version of Java and run jsXe using that version.

*Unix/Linux*

To run jsXe you should just run the java interpreter on the jsXe.jar file. There
is a shell script or batch file included in the source tree for this purpose.

./bin/jsXe.sh

The shell script should be run in with the jsXe root directory of as the
working directory. You can also edit the JSXEDIR variable in the shell script
to be the directory where you installed jsXe.
