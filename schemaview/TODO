* Build the flow layout so that nodes are formatted and displayed properly. They
  should not overlap or cross edges.
  
* Make each node look nicer. They should have some padding between the border
  and the text.

* Implement an intermediate tree model between the graph model and the
  XMLDocument that allows easy access to parent nodes and children. It will
  also allow easier access to nodes for editing.

* Begin to build in the editing features.
