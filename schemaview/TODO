* The cells/nodes should be named based on the name of the type.

* Make the cells shaped differently for different types of nodes (rounded
  corners etc.).

* Create an icon for the choice and sequence nodes so they look more like
  XMLSpy

* Allow the display of more information for each cell such as the name of a
  complexType, simpleType or element for example.

* Allow collapsing of the schema tree.

* Size each cell based on the size of the text within it.

* Look at Edge.Routing to try to orthoganal lines connecting nodes.

* Maybe add a panel that displays the schema roots and allows you to choose one
  to display like in XMLSpy.

* Explore key, unique, keyref, annotation, list, restriction, list, and union
  elements. How should they be displayed?

* Show attributes that the type can have.

* Build into the schema tree inherited attributes from other types. Show a box
  around the attributes like XMLSpy.

* Begin to build in the editing features.
    * Override insert and remove methods in SchemaViewGraphModel to catch
      insert and remove events so they can be passed to the Tree model.
    * Add a context menu that pops up when right clicking on nodes to allow you
      to add and remove nodes from the schema tree.
