<h3>History</h3>
<p>
jsXe was originally a project for an undergraduate special topics course i took
on design patterns in java. After about a month of learning java and developing
i churned out an application that could view XML documents in a tree view with
support for a few other simple XML constructs. The application only supported
viewing an XML document when i turned it in but it was always my vision that it
would support editing XML documents.
</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>
i decided to try and finish what i started and add all the features i wanted to
add to the project, perhaps some more if it becomes popular. Because jsXe was
originally a project for a class on design patterns and object oriented design i
have formulated a vision of an XML editor that has cleanly written code while
maintaining its ease of use. It is a vision to make life easier for anyone using
jsXe or anyone who is reading its code. Part of this vision was that jsXe would
not be geared toward any particular type of XML document. This may limit the
practicality of jsXe but i want it to be an XML editor and not an editor for an
<i>application</i> of XML. Another part of my vision of jsXe is that a user can
create a full featured XML document easily without ever looking at the source.
Of course the source will always be available however. i hope you agree with
this vision but if you think it should be any other way i encourage you to <a
