                      jsXe: Java Simple XML Editor

jsXe is the Java Simple XML Editor. Although you may pronounce it any way you
wish I encourage you to pronounce it "jay sexy". It is written in java using the
Swing toolkit, JAXP, and DOM and is released under the terms of the GNU General
Public License. It aims to provide end users and developers with an intuitive
way of creating XML documents. It is geared towards simpler XML documents but
will (eventually) be able to handle any XML document. Visit
